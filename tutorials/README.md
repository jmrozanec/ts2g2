# TECH DEBT

## IVANA
 - rename newtest.py following best practices and include among tests, not among tutorials
 - update tutorial comparing embeddings: (i) first compute cosine similarity between embeddings and a one-valued vector, (ii) compute the NDCG score: ndcg_score(similarity scores for ts embeddings, similarity scores for graph embeddings, k=10), (iii) understand most important differences in ranking.  
 - provide specific tutorials for each of the ts2g strategies, briefly explaining the particularities and parameters.

# ZAN
 - shall we delete the deprecated-test_code.ipynb notebook?
 - extract oscillation.py and poskus.py code into the corresponding files.
 - better document tutorial-01, so that the reader can understand the model behind it.
 - ensure all comments and explanations are in English
